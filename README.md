# WeatherMovieApi
 A Restful api with spring boot that returns a list of movies based on the temperature of the time that<br/> is to your city, using two apis of consumption openweathermap api themoviedb api


## When starting the project, by default the port will be 8080 in which case you can initialize using the url:
```
http://localhost:8080/weatherMovie/movies
```

## You can also use a swagger facilitator as a great way to use this API.
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

## We used two APIs:
